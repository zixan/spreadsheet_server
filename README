This tool was built to aid rapid web tool development where the logic was
already implemented in Microsoft Excel/LibreOffice Calc. Instead of rewriting
the logic from scratch, this tool was born.

It has been developed to work on a headless GNU/Linux system.

--------
Features
--------
* 'Instant' access to cells in the spreadsheets because they open in LibreOffice
Calc.
* All the function calculation support and power of LibreOffice Calc.
* Server requests are threaded so concurrent connections are supported.
* Each spreadsheet can be independently locked and unlocked to deal with state
changes in the spreadsheet.
* Spreadsheets can be saved - for debugging purposes.

------------
How it works
------------
A LibreOffice instance is launched by 'server.py' in a headless state.
By default, the './spreadsheets' directory is polled every 60 seconds for file
changes.
New spreadsheets in the directoy are opened with LibreOffice and removed spreadsheets are closed
in LibreOffice.
The 'client_python2.py' connects to the server and can update cells and retrieve
their calculated content.

Requirements
------------
Server:
	LibreOffice Calc
	python3
	virtualenv created with '--system-site-packages' argument
		   (For example: "virtualenv --system-site-packages -p python3 venv")

	Python packages installed to the virtualenv:
	pyoo (for the connection to LibreOffice)
	werkzeug (for securing filenames when saving spreadsheets)
	
Client:
	python2
